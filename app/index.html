                <p>Chickens don't clap! You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. What have we always said is the most important thing?</p>

Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where? A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money. Everybody dance NOW. Steve Holt? The moron jock? Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit.</p>

In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. No, she's in it. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. You can control your bladder when you're dead! We'll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves.</p>

Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. It's ok. You be with Yam. We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane.</p>
