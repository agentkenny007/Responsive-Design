So, some of the dummy text comes from [Bluth Ipsum](http://bluthipsum.com/), which consists of awkwardly inserted, slightly crude quotes from a show called [Arrested Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development_(TV_series)). I almost wish I had written it myself.

Look for [mockups](https://github.com/agentkenny007/Responsive-Design/tree/master/app/images) of versions of a [mobile layout](https://github.com/agentkenny007/Responsive-Design/blob/master/app/images/mobile-portrait.png), a layout for [tablets and phablets](https://github.com/agentkenny007/Responsive-Design/blob/master/app/images/tablet-portrait.png), as well as a version of a [desktop layout](https://github.com/agentkenny007/Responsive-Design/blob/master/app/images/desktop-landscape.png) in the project's [images](https://github.com/agentkenny007/Responsive-Design/tree/master/app/images) folder.
